Abstract: The evolution of T cell molecular signatures in the distal lung of patients with severe pneumonia is understudied. Here, we analyzed T cell subsets in longitudinal bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 273 patients with severe pneumonia, including unvaccinated patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or with respiratory failure not linked to pneumonia. In patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, activation of interferon signaling pathways, low activation of the NF-κB pathway and preferential targeting of spike and nucleocapsid proteins early after intubation were associated with favorable outcomes, whereas loss of interferon signaling, activation of NF-κB-driven programs and specificity for the ORF1ab complex late in disease were associated with mortality. These results suggest that in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, alveolar T cell interferon responses targeting structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins characterize individuals who recover, whereas responses against nonstructural proteins and activation of NF-κB are associated with poor outcomes.
